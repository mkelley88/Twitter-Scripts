# Twitter-Scripts
A small collection of scripts I've written for twitter. All scripts in this folder are bound by the LICENSE contained within.


PI-Tweet-Counter.py
-------------------
This script was written to count tweets from Twitter between two specific dates/times. It uses Tweepy for the API library. You must add in your own API keys/secrets from Twitter in order to use.

Current Bugs
-------------
It should be noted, the printout showing the date and number of tweets for that day is inaccurate.

Example:
[ 01-01-2018: 5 ] where 5 is the number of tweets in the previous 24 hour period. I will fix this soon.
