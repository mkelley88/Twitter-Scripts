# Twitter-Scripts
A small collection of scripts I've written for twitter. All scripts in this folder are bound by the LICENSE contained within.


PI-Tweet-Counter.py
-------------------
This script was written to count tweets from Twitter between two specific dates/times. It uses Tweepy for the API library. You must add in your own API keys/secrets from Twitter in order to use.
